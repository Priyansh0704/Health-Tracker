Following a consultation that revealed elevated cardiovascular risk markers (ApoB and hs-CRP), Rohan Patel began a new lifestyle plan focused on targeted nutrition and exercise. His adherence was inconsistent, and a business trip to Jakarta caused a significant spike in his blood pressure and disrupted his routine. After the trip, the team helped him recover, bringing his BP back down with a gentle plan. The month concluded with a new goal of 75% adherence for August, reflecting the lessons learned from the travel disruption.
