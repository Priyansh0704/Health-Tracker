Rohan Patel traveled extensively to London and Jakarta in March, which made it difficult for him to stick to his diet and workout plans. His support team provided adapted exercise and nutrition advice to accommodate his schedule, addressing challenges like time constraints and stress. After his travels, a check-up with Dr. Warren revealed elevated blood pressure, leading to an adjustment in his medication. The month concluded with Rohan completing full diagnostics and his team monitoring his health while planning his next business trip.
