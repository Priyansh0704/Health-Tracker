Rohan's month was defined by a week-long business trip to London, which significantly disrupted his health routine and caused his blood pressure to spike to 140/90 upon his return. His care team proactively planned for the trip with travel-specific workouts and nutrition advice. Following the trip, they implemented a successful 3-day recovery protocol that quickly stabilized his blood pressure back to his baseline. The experience highlighted that managing travel remains his biggest challenge, though his ability to recover is improving.
