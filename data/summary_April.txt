Rohan struggled to maintain his health routine in April due to frequent business trips to London, Jakarta, and South Korea. The stress from travel led to elevated blood pressure, which required two check-ups with Dr. Warren and resulted in an adjustment to his medication. Throughout the month, Rohan received continuous advice from his team on adapting workouts, nutrition, and stress management for his hectic schedule. By the end of April, he reported feeling less stressed with his blood pressure back under control.
