Rohan Patel started the month recovering from travel-induced jet lag and high blood pressure, with his health team providing a gentle exercise and nutrition plan. His routine was quickly disrupted by another stressful business trip to New York, causing his BP to spike again. Upon his return, Rohan completed a full diagnostic panel, which revealed elevated inflammatory markers and ApoB, confirming the negative impact of his travel. The month concluded with Rohan scheduling a consultation with his doctor to review these results and establish a more focused health plan.
